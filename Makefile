# `make help` is the canonical source of truth for every target this repo
# supports. Run it before adding anything new. Lint, build, test, deadcode,
# release, baseline, and service-install all live in the central go-makefile
# pipeline fetched at parse time. Do NOT add project-local lint, deadcode,
# audit, fmt, vet, or staticcheck targets here. They duplicate the central
# pipeline and let agents bypass strict rules.
